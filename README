FIFO implementation test


https://hackaday.com/2015/10/29/embed-with-elliot-going-round-with-circular-buffers/

As the FIFO is circular, size must be 
size = wantedSize+1
An index is not used when FIFO is consider FULL. 
This implement is descibed in the previous link.
To determine if the FIFO is full the test is to check if the write pointer (head) position
can be increased without being equal to the read pointer (tail).
To determine if the FIFO is empty, the test check if the read pointer(tail) is 
equal to the write pointer (head).
